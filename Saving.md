# Saving
 1. ## Why
 The number one reason for saving money is Murphy's Law. "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong." You should be saving for many reasons, but particularly due to an emergency that may come up unexpectedly. This will happen and often at very inconvinent times. 
 
 2. ## When
 You should save before you start investing. This is the number one thing that good financial advisers recommend and I will as well. Before you start conquering the world with your stocks, bonds, etf, options, etc., you need to get 3 - 6 months of your expenses put away into a liquid form of accessible money. 
 
 
 3. ## How
There are many ways to save money but I would like to start with where you should put this, I will follow this up with methodoligies. 
- You should be putting this money into a High Yield Savings Account. This is the most recommended place to keep your liquid emergency fund and start your Financial journey. The reason for this is HYSAs give you interest of up to 1.5%+ at the time of writing this which is far greater than your average checking or savings accounts that may only give you 0.1% interest on your money. With inflation, you are actually losing money due to the actuality of this being around 2% per year.
