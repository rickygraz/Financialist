Before we get started lets discuss a few topics and philosophies that I beileve anyone getting into this should understand and contemplate practicing.

- Money is not everything, it will make you temporarily happy but you can not take it with you when you die so you should dedicate just as much time to this as you would anything else you are passinoate about. 
- Having investing/making money as a passion will eventually leave you down a wormhole and you could potentially end up losing many friends/family/loved ones due to what an obsession this can create; however, if you control your desires for it you can make this work while not obsessing over it. 
- Money does give you many things and the most important of these is time, this is what the ultra-wealthy buy is time and to many this is priceless. 
- Unless you are wanting to make investing a career, you should look at the long term.
